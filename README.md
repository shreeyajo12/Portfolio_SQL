# COVID-19 Data Exploration Project

# Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive SQL-based data exploration project focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic, spanning from its onset in 2020 to the present day. The project aims to uncover insights into the pandemic's impact on global health metrics, including case counts, death rates, and vaccination efforts. Through rigorous data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis, this work provides a deep dive into the pandemic's evolution and its effects on different countries and continents.

# Objectives
To analyze COVID-19-related deaths, cases, and vaccination rates globally.
To calculate and compare death percentages across different regions, specifically focusing on high-impact areas such as India and the United States.
To explore the relationship between population sizes and COVID-19 infection rates, identifying countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.
To investigate vaccination efforts, evaluating the percentage of populations vaccinated over time.

# Technologies Used
SQL Server(SSMS): For data querying and manipulation.
[PortfolioProjects-DataCleaning] Database: Primary data source for COVID-19 deaths, cases, and vaccinations.
